            <h2> <=> Diffrance between Let const var</h2>
            <h6> => The main difference between let and var is that scope of a variable defined with let is limited to the block in which it is declared while variable declared with var has the global scope. So we can say that var is rather a keyword which defines a variable globally regardless of block scope. </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="row bg-info rounded  p-2 m-4">
            <h2> <=> Diffrance between Arrow Function and normal Function</h2>
            <h6> => Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function.</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="row bg-success text-white rounded  p-2 m-4">
            <h2> <=> Diffrance between Map, ForEach, Filter, find</h2>
            <h6> => The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value</h6>

            <h2> <=> why we will use template string in javascript</h2>
            <h6> =>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements</h6>
